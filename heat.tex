\subsection{Q(t)}

We are now interested in computing : 
$$Q(t) = \int_0\int_0 q(x,y,t)dxdy$$

Using the fundamental theorem of calculus, we have :
$$Q(t) = Q(0) + \int_0 Q'(\tau)d\tau$$

The initial condition gives :
$$Q(0) =\int_0\int_0 q(x,y,0)dxdy = \int_0\int_0 0 \: dxdy = 0$$

We also know that (using the definition of $Q$) :
$$Q'(t) = \int_0\int_0 q_t(x,y,t)dxdy$$

We are now going to use the PDE to substitute $q_t$. This yields :
$$Q'(t) = \int_0\int_0 q_t(x,y,t)dxdy = \int_0\int_0 \nabla \cdot (\nabla q(x,y,t))dxdy+\int_0\int_0 S(x,y,t) dxdy$$
